For the #0 level the username and the password was provided by the site.\
For the #1 level i entered the ls command, it showed a readme file, then i entered the cat readme command and i obtained the passcode.\
For the #2 level, i entered ls command and i saw a file named "-", to see it's content i entered the command cat./- \
For the #3 level i saw with the ls command that it showed: spaces in this filename. To overpass this problem and to execute the cat command, i entered: $ cat "spaces in this filename" for it to be able to print the content of the file.\
For the #4 level i entered ls and it showed inhere, i run the cd inhere command and entered the file. When i entered ls it showed nothing. So, I though that I should have hidden files. I run the ls -a command and show a file named .hidden. Then, i run $ cat .hidden command and show the password.
